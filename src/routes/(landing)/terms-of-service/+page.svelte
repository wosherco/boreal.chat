    of your account.

    To the extent necessary to provide and maintain the Service, you grant us a worldwide,
    non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and process your User Content.

  <h2>4. Fees and Payment</h2>
  <p>
    Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a

    reliable. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content provided by these
    third-party services.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You can stop using the Service and terminate these Terms at any time by deleting your account.
