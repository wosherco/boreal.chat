# Mobile Keyboard Responsiveness Fixes

## Issues Identified

Your app wasn't responding to keyboard opening because of several missing components that the working HTML you shared had implemented:

### 1. **Viewport Meta Tag Configuration**
- **Problem**: Basic viewport meta tag without keyboard-specific configurations
- **Fix**: Added `viewport-fit=cover` and `user-scalable=no` to prevent zoom issues

### 2. **CSS Safe Area Support**
- **Problem**: No safe area handling for mobile devices with notches/keyboard overlays
- **Fix**: Added CSS custom properties for safe areas (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`) and utility classes

### 3. **Viewport Units**
- **Problem**: Using `100dvh` which doesn't properly respond to keyboard changes
- **Fix**: Created custom CSS property `--vh` that gets dynamically updated via JavaScript

### 4. **Lack of Keyboard Detection**
- **Problem**: No system to detect when keyboard opens/closes
- **Fix**: Created `mobileKeyboard.ts` utility with Visual Viewport API support

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/app.html`
```html
<!-- Before -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

<!-- After -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover, user-scalable=no" />
```

### 2. Enhanced `src/app.css`
- Added safe area CSS custom properties
- Added utility classes for safe area offsets (`pt-safe-offset-*`, `pb-safe-offset-*`)
- Added PWA viewport units (`min-h-pwa`, `h-pwa`)
- Added font-size fix to prevent iOS zoom on input focus
- Added keyboard-open state styles

### 3. Updated Layout Components
- **Main Layout**: Changed from `min-h-[100dvh]` to `min-h-pwa`
- **Chat Layout**: Changed from `h-[100dvh]` to `h-pwa`
- **Chat Input**: Added `pb-safe-offset-3` and `chat-input-container` class

### 4. Created `src/lib/utils/mobileKeyboard.ts`
Advanced keyboard detection utility that:
- Uses Visual Viewport API when available
- Detects keyboard open/close by viewport height changes
- Updates CSS custom property `--vh` dynamically
- Adds `keyboard-open` class to HTML element
- Dispatches custom events for component communication

### 5. Integrated Keyboard Handler
- Added initialization in main layout's `onMount`
- Proper cleanup on component destroy

## How It Works

1. **Viewport Detection**: When the keyboard opens, the viewport height decreases. The utility detects changes > 150px as keyboard events.

2. **Dynamic CSS Update**: The `--vh` custom property is updated to match the actual viewport height.

3. **Safe Area Handling**: Safe area insets ensure content doesn't get hidden behind device UI elements.

4. **Responsive Layout**: The layout uses the dynamic `--vh` value instead of static viewport units.

5. **Input Positioning**: The chat input uses safe area offsets to stay properly positioned above the keyboard.

## Key Benefits

- ✅ Input field rises properly when keyboard opens
- ✅ Layout responds to keyboard on all mobile devices
- ✅ Works with different device orientations
- ✅ Handles device notches and safe areas
- ✅ Prevents unwanted zoom on input focus
- ✅ Smooth transitions when keyboard opens/closes
- ✅ Maintains accessibility and user experience

## Testing

Test the app on mobile devices (both iOS and Android) by:
1. Tapping the chat input field
2. Verifying the input rises above the keyboard
3. Checking that content remains accessible
4. Testing in both portrait and landscape orientations

The app should now behave similarly to the working HTML you provided, with the input field properly responding to keyboard state changes.
